# Equo Editor

The [Equo Editor](https://www.equoplatform.com/request-a-demo) can be used and embedded in any desktop application. It also works a drop-in replacement for the Eclipse Generic Editor. Itâ€™s based on the Monaco web editor (same as VSCode). It brings the beauty and the capabilities of a modern editor into.

You can add the Language Protocol Server (LSP) you want to Eclipse so that [Equo Editor](https://www.equoplatform.com/request-a-demo) helps you easily write your code into your files like modern IDEs do.
